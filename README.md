# shortest_path_finder

This Python project implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve a complex maze. Using the curses library, it visualizes the real-time process of finding the shortest path from the entrance to the exit. The maze is generated with random walls and paths, and the BFS algorithm explores the maze step-by-step until the optimal path is found. This project demonstrates algorithm visualization and pathfinding techniques in Python.
